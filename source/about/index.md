It's not hard to find me on Google, [Doubt?](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=diullei) My name is Diullei, I'm from Brazil and I'm a Software Developer. I like to say that "I do what I love and I love what I do" :)

Currently I live in Oslo - Norway and I work as a [full-stack](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-term-full-stack-programmer-mean-What-are-the-defining-traits-of-a-full-stack-programmer) Developer at [Resoptima](http://resoptima.com/). Usually I like to play with C#, F#, JavaScript, AngularJS, React, TypeScript, Go, Python, SQL, Asp.NET, [rubik's cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube), etc, etc ...

I like to get involved with developer communities and open-source projects. I had the incredible opportunity to contribute to the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) community by creating the [DefinitelyTyped](/definitelyTyped/) organization along with Boris Yankov. I'm also author of [TSD - TypeScript package Manager](/tsd/).
